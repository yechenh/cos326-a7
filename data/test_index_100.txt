1@BAHIA COCOA REVIEW@Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.     The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.     Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures.     Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors.     There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.     In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.     Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.     Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.     New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB.     Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.     April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.     Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports.     Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct/Dec.     Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible currency areas.     Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.     Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88 crop.     Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which ends midday on February 27.  Reuter &#3;

4@TALKING POINT/BANKAMERICA &lt;BAC> EQUITY OFFER@BankAmerica Corp is not under pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor performance, banking analysts said.     Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.     BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments on a large portion of its foreign debt.     The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon, after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.     Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.     BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as one of the major factors leading the First Interstate withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.     A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.     "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do," said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.     "I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could," said Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith.     Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they have to show the market an improved financial outlook.     Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.     Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.     Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to ease over the coming weeks.     Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.     He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show up in the current quarter.     With other major banks standing to lose even more than BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

The company said the warrants are exercisable for five years at a purchase price of .125 dlrs per share.     Computer Terminal said Sedio also has the right to buy additional shares and increase its total holdings up to 40 pct of the Computer Terminal's outstanding common stock under certain circumstances involving change of control at the company.     The company said if the conditions occur the warrants would be exercisable at a price equal to 75 pct of its common stock's market price at the time, not to exceed 1.50 dlrs per share.     Computer Terminal also said it sold the technolgy rights to its Dot Matrix impact technology, including any future improvements, to &lt;Woodco Inc> of Houston, Tex. for 200,000 dlrs. But, it said it would continue to be the exclusive worldwide licensee of the technology for Woodco.

The company said any decline would be due to expenses related to the acquisitions in the middle of the current quarter of seven licensees of Sealy Inc, as well as 82 pct of the outstanding capital stock of Sealy.     Because of these acquisitions, it said, first quarter sales will be substantially higher than last year's 67.1 mln dlrs.     Noting that it typically reports first quarter results in late march, said the report is likely to be issued in early April this year.     It said the delay is due to administrative considerations, including conducting appraisals, in connection with the acquisitions.  Reuter &#3;

Douglas also said the year's sales should exceed 1.4 billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year.     He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter earnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40 cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share.     Douglas said it was too early to project whether the anticipated fourth quarter performance would be "enough for us to exceed the prior year's overall earnings" of 1.53 dlrs a share.     In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience "a 20 pct improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform act alone."     President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will derive  benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.     Dean also said the company will benefit from its acquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc, West Chicago.     He said the company is a major shareholder of E.B.I.

Brown-Forman said the split of its Class A and Class B common shares would be effective March 13.     The company said directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on each new share of both classes of 28 cts, payable April one to holders of record March 20.

Brown-Forman today reported a 37 pct increase in third  quarter profits to 21.6 mln dlrs, or 1.00 dlr a share, on a seven pct increase in sales to a record 337 mln dlrs.     Brown-Forman said nine month profits declined a bit to 66.0 mln dlrs, or 3.07 dlrs a share, from 66.2 mln dlrs, or 3.08 dlrs a share, a year earlier due to a second quarter charge of 37 cts a share for restructuring its beverage operations.

26@BANKERS REPORT BREAKTHROUGH ON VENEZUELAN DEBT@Venezuela and its bank advisory committee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last February, bankers said.     They declined to disclose details because two or three representatives on the panel have still to obtain the approval of their senior management for the new terms.     The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon and could put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today, the bankers said.     "A number of details have still to be finalized, but the broad details of the new amortization schedules and interest rates are in place," one senior banker said.     The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at 1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, but Venezuela requested easier terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year.     It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due to make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed - and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new investment in Venezuela.     The breakthrough in the Venezuelan talks, which have been going on intermittently for several months, follows the announcement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debt rescheduling pact between Chile and its bank advisory panel.     And last night Citibank said Mexico's financing package, including a 7.7 billion dlr loan, will be signed on March 20.     While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental, bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successes after the shock of Brazil's unilateral interest suspension last Friday. By striking swift deals, banks hope to reduce the incentive for other debtors to emulate Brazil.  Reuter &#3;

28@TOWER REPORT DIMINISHES REAGAN'S HOPES OF REBOUND@The Tower Commission report, which says President Reagan was ignorant about much of the Iran arms deal, just about ends his prospects of regaining political dominance in Washington, political analysts said.     "This is certification of incompetence," private political analyst Stephen Hess told Reuters in commenting on the Tower report made public today.     "It's as if he went before a professional licensing board and was denied credentials."     In one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman John Tower, a longtime Reagan supporter and former Republican senator from Texas, told a press conference, "The president clearly did not understand the nature of this operation."     The report, which lent credence to widespread opinion in Washington that Reagan is not in full command of the government, was particularly damaging because it was prepared by a board of the Republican president's own choosing.     The three-member panel made up of Tower, former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticism from a Congress controlled by the Democratic party.     "We're falling by our own hand," said one Republican political strategist. "What can we say except 'we're sorry, we won't do it again'?"     The strategist, who works for one of his party's top 1988 presidential contenders and asked not to be identified, said the report was like "an anvil falling on us."     Hess, with the Brookings Institution public policy study group, said the report is the final blow to Reagan's hopes of regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with Congress, the press and the Washington bureaucracy.     The report may also undermine the standing of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keeping their own skirts clean than supporting the president.     "They protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences," it said.     White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strong criticism, but the blows were expected in their cases.     Regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged for allegedly failing both to help Reagan conduct the Iran initiative and to avoid "chaos" in the disclosure process.     Casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous brain tumor in December, had already resigned for health reasons last month.     "This is a story about people who came up somewhat short of being heroes," Tower told reporters.     While Reagan retains considerable constitutional powers, including command of the armed forces and the right to veto legislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him to retake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly with Congress controlled by the Democrats.     The crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the man in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair.     Although his job approval rating has fallen as much as twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms deal with Iran became public last November, his personal popularity is still relatively high.     A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showed that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought Reagan was in control of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was doing a good job as president.     American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider, a Democrat, says Reagan's loss of support among Washington power brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public.     "In the past, he has been able to go around the power elite by appealing directly to the public," Schneider said.     Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised address next week.     But one top Republican strategist warned against expecting a dramatic turnaround.     "The White House has to avoid building expectations that cannot be met," said the strategist, who requested anonymity. "They have to recognize there is no quick fix."     Analysts also point out that Reagan's personal popularity has not always translated into public backing for his policies.     They note he was dramatically rebuffed in last November's elections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control of the Senate to the Democrats.  Reuter &#3;
29@JANUARY HOUSING SALES DROP, REALTY GROUP SAYS@Sales of previously owned homes dropped 14.5 pct in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.47 mln units, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said.     But the December rate of 4.06 mln units had been the highest since the record 4.15 mln unit sales rate set in November 1978, the group said.     "The drop in January is not surprising considering that a significant portion of December's near-record pace was made up of sellers seeking to get favorable capital gains treatment under the old tax laws," said the NAR's John Tuccillo.

32@SENATORS INTRODUCE EXPORT LICENSING REFORM BILL@Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.     "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items where such actions will not endanger our national security, and eliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authority over the licensing process," Cranston said.     "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to 70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a more rational...licensing process will boost exports."     U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc countries access to technology that could further their military capabilities.     "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.     "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans told reporters.

45@CHEMLAWN &lt;CHEM> RISES ON HOPES FOR HIGHER BIDS@ChemLawn Corp &lt;CHEM> could attract a higher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste Management Inc &lt;WNX>, Wall Street arbitrageurs said.     Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1 mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.     "This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs, maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing bidder," an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer, announced before the opening today, expires March 25.     "This is totally by surprise," said Debra Strohmaier, a ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not certain when it would be ready.      She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.     "I think they will resist it," said Elliott Schlang, analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. "Any company that doesn't like a surprise attack would."     Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn could try to find a white knight if does not want to be acquired by Waste Management.     Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said ServiceMaster Companies L.P. &lt;SVM> or Rollins Inc &lt;ROL> were examples of companies that could be interested.     ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S. company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of wastes.     Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to another company that wants to capitalize on a strong residential and commercial distribution system.     Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.     Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.     Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice.  Reuter &#3;

47@BRAZIL ANTI-INFLATION PLAN LIMPS TO ANNIVERSARY@inflation plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.     Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250 pct inflation rate.     But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.     "The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was inflation, at least the economy worked," a leading bank economist said.     The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and 1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr foreign debt.     For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged under 150 mln.  Reuter &#3;

54@U.S. DATA POINT TO CAPITAL SPENDING SLOWDOWN@A surprise 7.5 pct drop in U.S. January durable goods orders points to a slowdown in capital spending that could presage lackluster real growth in the U.S. economy in the first quarter of 1987, economists said.     With total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector, falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the report painted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy.     But they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be a primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital investment.     "It's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said David Wyss of Data Resources Inc. "I'm particularly impressed by the 19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to tax reform than we thought."     The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in office and computing equipment orders.     Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws.     "It's more expensive to invest than it used to be, so people just aren't doing it as much," Wyss said.      Increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforced the view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws, economists said.     November durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and December's increased 1.5 pct, revised upwards from a previously reported 0.9 pct.     But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was caused by more than tax reform.     "The wash-out that took place in January was far greater than the actual gains that took place in November and December," said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "The economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year."     "The report definitely points to very sluggish capital spending over the next couple of quarters," said Donald Maude of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc.     Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. In November, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in December they fell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct, he said.     "It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, which may quickly translate to a drop in production," Midland Montagu's Maude said.     Wyss cautioned that too much should not be made of January's report, given that other reports have reflected strength.     But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51 pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline in December.     He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in January shipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December.     "Given these numbers, there's no reason for the Fed to tighten," Data Resources' Wyss said.     "But there's no reason to ease unless we see more numbers like this. The Fed will wait and see," he added.     Sullivan predicted the Fed will ease by Easter. "People aren't talking recession or Fed easing now, but the Fed will have to ease to ensure global growth."

60@ARGENTINA COULD SUSPEND DEBT PAYMENTS - DEPUTY@Argentina could suspend payments on its foreign debt if creditor banks reject a 2.15 billion dlr loan request to meet 1987 growth targets, ruling Radical Party Deputy Raul Baglini told a local radio station.     "Argentina does not discard the use of (a moratorium) if the negotiations do not produce a result that guarantees the growth of the country," he added.     Baglini, an observer at Argentina's negotiations in New York with the steering committee for its 320 creditors banks, told the Radio del Plata in a telephone interview that the banks were divided on the loan request.     Baglini said that as a result, today's scheduled second day of talks had been postponed.     He said Argentina was prepared to follow the example of Brazil, which last week declared a moratorium on interest payments of a large portion of its 108 billion dlr foreign debt.     Argentina's prime objective in renegotiating the debt was to maintain growth, which has been targeted at four pct in 1987, Baglini said.     "Debtor nations should not have to take from their own pockets, that is their commercial balance, to meet interest payments," he added.  Reuter &#3;
61@KEY U.S. TAX WRITERS SEEK ESTATE TAX CURBS@The chairmen and senior Republican members of the House and Senate tax writing committees proposed legislation to curb estate tax deduction on sales of stock to an employee stock ownership plan.     The proposal would raise federal revenues of 6.7 billion dlrs over the fiscal year period 1987 to 1991.     If adopted by Congress it would effect all transactions after Sept 26, 1987.     The plan was proposed by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill), Rep John Duncan (R-Tenn), Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex) and Sen Bob Packwood (R-Ore).     In a statement Rostenkowski said the estate tax deduction enacted last year as part of the tax reform bill was too broad and would have cost the governmet seven billion dlrs over four years. The narrower deduction would cost the government less than 300 mln dlrs for the same years.     He said it was designed to avoid sham transactions which allowed estates to avoid taxes by transferring stock to ESOPs.     Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said in a statement, "The Tax Reform Act contains a provision that allows many wealthy individuals to avoid the federal estate tax entirely when they die."     He added, "The provision was intended to encourage estates to sell stock to employee stock ownership plans as a way of promoting worker ownership; however, the provision was not meant to be broad enough to reduce federal revenues as much as is currently estimated."     He added, "The bill I have introduced today calls for the modification of the provision in accordance with its intended purpose."  Reuter &#3;

79@QUEBECOR &lt;PQB> HEAD SEES NEW VENTURES LIKELY@Quebecor Inc, one of Canada's largest publishing and printing companies, is likely to launch a new daily newspaper in Montreal, probably this fall, president Pierre Peladeau told Reuters in an interview.     The company, which last week won a bid to buy the Quebec government's 55 pct interest in pulp and paper company &lt;Donohue Inc>, will also likely go ahead with plans to build a new paper mill in Matane, Quebec, Peladeau said.     "I would say we will move (ahead with the daily).... This is not definite but i think we will," he said, adding that he plans to announce a decision early next week.     Quebecor, which had revenues of 446 mln Canadian dlrs last year and profit of 16.2 mln dlrs, already publishes three daily newspapers, including the tabloid Le Journal de Montreal, the second-largest circulation paper in Canada.     A new daily would give Montreal its second English- language paper and its sixth daily newspaper, making the city the most crowded metropolitan newspaper market in North America, analysts have said.     Peladeau said market studies have indicated a new English language tabloid would have circulation of 50,000 within six months. He said he is waiting to determine whether the new venture would have the support of major advertisers.     Peladeau, who together with family members owns about 55 pct of Quebecor, said he has recieved offers from the heads of two major Canadian companies who are interested in the project but has not decided whether he would take partners in the newspaper venture.     He said he would consider launching the newspaper with one of the companies as a prelude to other joint ventures.     "It would be the possibility of doing something else in the short term," Peladeau said.     Peladeau said the joint acquisition of Donohue with Robert Maxwell's British Printing and Communications Corp plc &lt;BPCL.L> does not mean Quebecor will have to hold off on other projects.     Peladeau and Maxwell's companies teamed up to buy the stake in Donohue, which resulted in Quebecor buying 51 pct of the govvernment's stake for about 165 mln Canadian dlrs and British printing acquiring the other 49 pct.     "In 1976 or 77 there was a tremendous shortage of newsprint. There were days when we didn't have enough paper to print the paper," Peladeau said. "When I lived that, I said to myself...next time we'll be ready."     Peladeau said most of Donohue's current total newsprint capacity however, is already committed to other buyers.     Quebecor uses about 100,000 metric tons of newsprint a year and Maxwell's company, which publishes Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper, uses about 200,000 tonnes.     Peladeau said even with a new 170 mln dlr paper machine, 49 pct owned by the New York Times, (NYT.A), adding to Donohue's 540,000 metric tonne capacity this fall, the companies will have to install another paper machine at Amos, Quebec, or build another mill to meet their demands .     He said a new mill, which would produce either newsprint or other types of paper, would cost 400-500 mln dlrs and could be on stream in two years. He said a mill in Matane, a depressed area with high unemployment, would be heavily subsidized by the government.     Peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventures with Maxwell's company, either in the newspaper market in France or in the U.S., where the company owns two large printing plants and is looking to expand its newspaper empire.     He said Maxwell's sons, who are French citizens, would provide an entree into the French market, where foreigners are prevented from buying newspapers. Peladeau said he would consider either buying into or starting daily newspapers in France or the U.S.     Quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain of about 40 weekly newspapers, with the possible acquisition of two groups of weekly newspapers in the U.S., and is negotiating the acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in Canada, Peladeau said.     He said the company may consider starting daily newspapers in two small Quebec cities and buying radio stations in the province.     Peladeau said Quebecor may also consider trading in its listing on the American stock exchange for a New York Stock Exchange listing.  Reuter &#3;
