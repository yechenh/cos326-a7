1@BAHIA COCOA REVIEW@Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.     The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.     Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures.     Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors.     There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.     In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.     Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.     Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.     New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB.     Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.     April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.     Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports.     Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct/Dec.     Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible currency areas.     Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.     Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88 crop.     Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which ends midday on February 27.  Reuter &#3;

4@TALKING POINT/BANKAMERICA &lt;BAC> EQUITY OFFER@BankAmerica Corp is not under pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor performance, banking analysts said.     Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.     BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments on a large portion of its foreign debt.     The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon, after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.     Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.     BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as one of the major factors leading the First Interstate withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.     A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.     "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do," said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.     "I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could," said Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith.     Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they have to show the market an improved financial outlook.     Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.     Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.     Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to ease over the coming weeks.     Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.     He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show up in the current quarter.     With other major banks standing to lose even more than BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

The company said the warrants are exercisable for five years at a purchase price of .125 dlrs per share.     Computer Terminal said Sedio also has the right to buy additional shares and increase its total holdings up to 40 pct of the Computer Terminal's outstanding common stock under certain circumstances involving change of control at the company.     The company said if the conditions occur the warrants would be exercisable at a price equal to 75 pct of its common stock's market price at the time, not to exceed 1.50 dlrs per share.     Computer Terminal also said it sold the technolgy rights to its Dot Matrix impact technology, including any future improvements, to &lt;Woodco Inc> of Houston, Tex. for 200,000 dlrs. But, it said it would continue to be the exclusive worldwide licensee of the technology for Woodco.

The company said any decline would be due to expenses related to the acquisitions in the middle of the current quarter of seven licensees of Sealy Inc, as well as 82 pct of the outstanding capital stock of Sealy.     Because of these acquisitions, it said, first quarter sales will be substantially higher than last year's 67.1 mln dlrs.     Noting that it typically reports first quarter results in late march, said the report is likely to be issued in early April this year.     It said the delay is due to administrative considerations, including conducting appraisals, in connection with the acquisitions.  Reuter &#3;

Douglas also said the year's sales should exceed 1.4 billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year.     He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter earnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40 cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share.     Douglas said it was too early to project whether the anticipated fourth quarter performance would be "enough for us to exceed the prior year's overall earnings" of 1.53 dlrs a share.     In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience "a 20 pct improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform act alone."     President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will derive  benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.     Dean also said the company will benefit from its acquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc, West Chicago.     He said the company is a major shareholder of E.B.I.

Brown-Forman said the split of its Class A and Class B common shares would be effective March 13.     The company said directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on each new share of both classes of 28 cts, payable April one to holders of record March 20.

Brown-Forman today reported a 37 pct increase in third  quarter profits to 21.6 mln dlrs, or 1.00 dlr a share, on a seven pct increase in sales to a record 337 mln dlrs.     Brown-Forman said nine month profits declined a bit to 66.0 mln dlrs, or 3.07 dlrs a share, from 66.2 mln dlrs, or 3.08 dlrs a share, a year earlier due to a second quarter charge of 37 cts a share for restructuring its beverage operations.

26@BANKERS REPORT BREAKTHROUGH ON VENEZUELAN DEBT@Venezuela and its bank advisory committee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last February, bankers said.     They declined to disclose details because two or three representatives on the panel have still to obtain the approval of their senior management for the new terms.     The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon and could put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today, the bankers said.     "A number of details have still to be finalized, but the broad details of the new amortization schedules and interest rates are in place," one senior banker said.     The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at 1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, but Venezuela requested easier terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year.     It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due to make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed - and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new investment in Venezuela.     The breakthrough in the Venezuelan talks, which have been going on intermittently for several months, follows the announcement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debt rescheduling pact between Chile and its bank advisory panel.     And last night Citibank said Mexico's financing package, including a 7.7 billion dlr loan, will be signed on March 20.     While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental, bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successes after the shock of Brazil's unilateral interest suspension last Friday. By striking swift deals, banks hope to reduce the incentive for other debtors to emulate Brazil.  Reuter &#3;

28@TOWER REPORT DIMINISHES REAGAN'S HOPES OF REBOUND@The Tower Commission report, which says President Reagan was ignorant about much of the Iran arms deal, just about ends his prospects of regaining political dominance in Washington, political analysts said.     "This is certification of incompetence," private political analyst Stephen Hess told Reuters in commenting on the Tower report made public today.     "It's as if he went before a professional licensing board and was denied credentials."     In one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman John Tower, a longtime Reagan supporter and former Republican senator from Texas, told a press conference, "The president clearly did not understand the nature of this operation."     The report, which lent credence to widespread opinion in Washington that Reagan is not in full command of the government, was particularly damaging because it was prepared by a board of the Republican president's own choosing.     The three-member panel made up of Tower, former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticism from a Congress controlled by the Democratic party.     "We're falling by our own hand," said one Republican political strategist. "What can we say except 'we're sorry, we won't do it again'?"     The strategist, who works for one of his party's top 1988 presidential contenders and asked not to be identified, said the report was like "an anvil falling on us."     Hess, with the Brookings Institution public policy study group, said the report is the final blow to Reagan's hopes of regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with Congress, the press and the Washington bureaucracy.     The report may also undermine the standing of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keeping their own skirts clean than supporting the president.     "They protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences," it said.     White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strong criticism, but the blows were expected in their cases.     Regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged for allegedly failing both to help Reagan conduct the Iran initiative and to avoid "chaos" in the disclosure process.     Casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous brain tumor in December, had already resigned for health reasons last month.     "This is a story about people who came up somewhat short of being heroes," Tower told reporters.     While Reagan retains considerable constitutional powers, including command of the armed forces and the right to veto legislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him to retake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly with Congress controlled by the Democrats.     The crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the man in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair.     Although his job approval rating has fallen as much as twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms deal with Iran became public last November, his personal popularity is still relatively high.     A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showed that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought Reagan was in control of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was doing a good job as president.     American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider, a Democrat, says Reagan's loss of support among Washington power brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public.     "In the past, he has been able to go around the power elite by appealing directly to the public," Schneider said.     Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised address next week.     But one top Republican strategist warned against expecting a dramatic turnaround.     "The White House has to avoid building expectations that cannot be met," said the strategist, who requested anonymity. "They have to recognize there is no quick fix."     Analysts also point out that Reagan's personal popularity has not always translated into public backing for his policies.     They note he was dramatically rebuffed in last November's elections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control of the Senate to the Democrats.  Reuter &#3;
29@JANUARY HOUSING SALES DROP, REALTY GROUP SAYS@Sales of previously owned homes dropped 14.5 pct in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.47 mln units, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said.     But the December rate of 4.06 mln units had been the highest since the record 4.15 mln unit sales rate set in November 1978, the group said.     "The drop in January is not surprising considering that a significant portion of December's near-record pace was made up of sellers seeking to get favorable capital gains treatment under the old tax laws," said the NAR's John Tuccillo.
